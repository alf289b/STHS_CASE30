## Usage

To use the code or resources in this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git

## Steps to get the results
You have all the files needed to obtain the results.

Follow the steps below:

1.Download the Matlab codes folder.

2.Open the "Results_graphs.m" file.

3.Add the path of the downloaded folder to the Matlab path.

4.Uncomment the case you want to run (only one at a time: Case 1, Case 2, or Case 3).

Additionally, the ANN used to obtain the load profile and the model used in GAMS are included.
It is strongly recommended to import as much data as possible for Sets and Tables using a GDX file
From MATLAB or Excel to GAMS and not insert them manually in GAMS for better information control.
